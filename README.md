# Memory Game Project

My version of Udacity's Front-End Web Development Project 2 utilizing HTML, CSS, the DOM, and basic JavaScript utilzing events to complete a memory matching game.

## How To Play

1. Download my project off of GitHub (Either manually or via forking)
2. Open the "index.html" in your browser of choice
3. The game will start automatically
4. To start a new game press the refresh button at the top right of the game box
5. Have fun!

## Scoring

Scoring is based on how many moves it takes you to find all of the matches. Currently, the seconds timer is just to see how fast you are.

## Post Mortem

Coming from C# and Kotlin I really am not a fan of JavaScipt. That being said, I had fun on this project as I did some game design and programming in college. This project was a nice "get back on the bike" project for me with all the game logic and event handling. If I had more a definitely know there are places where I could make the code more elegant but overall I'm happy with my work.
